# C-A-Helper
Swift app about how to perform CPR using AED

## App design
This is my first swift app. At first I want to make a wonderful app for teaching people how to perform CPR with AED because we can see AEDs in many public places but many of us may not have used them and are afraid to use AED when we see someone has an emergency. So C-A-Helper comes up!

By the way, it's not a beautiful app because of timing. Hope it helps you!
